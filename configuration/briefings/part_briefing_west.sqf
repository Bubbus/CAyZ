<br/>
The Meat Up wakes at once as dawn rises, but something is amiss. The fires have been dead for days, the meat is starting to spoil and the beers are warm. As you start to address this terrible fate, you begin to realise how bad it is. All the cars are dead, nobody's phones have signal. The only lead is the camp leader's emergency radio which, as the hour strikes, begins to speak...
